=====================
"Russian warship, go fuck yourself" was the last communication made by Roman Gribov, who was stationed on Snake Island on 24 February 2022 during the Russian attack on the island.  The phrase, and derivations of the phrase, became widely adopted during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. On 12 March 2022, the phrase was commemorated in a postage stamp by Ukrposhta, the Ukrainian postal service.
